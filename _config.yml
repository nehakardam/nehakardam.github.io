  Hi there! I'm a second-year PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Washington, Seattle.

  I am an interdisciplinary researcher with experience in using statistics, predictive analytics, mixed methods research and applying machine learning techniques in data driven research.
  My research interests include understanding and applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques in real world problems.

  I am passionate about using NLP in engineering education research (EER), with the goal ofÂ improving pedagogy and diversity in engineering education.

          Textual survey data is processed manually, researchers have to invest significant time and effort to evaluating such text survey collections. While in-depth manual research of text survey data yields significant outcomes, some instructors or administrators may benefit from an automated system that can uncover trends and offer broader overviews for selected datasets in less time and resource-efficient ways. This study investigates using Natural Language Processing (Topic modeling: Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Non-negative Matrix Factorization) techniques to extract labels from student short answer survey responses in the context of Engineering.

          A single dense output layer and a multi-layer dense output layer model is used to predict peer support labels based on cooperative learning framework. Sentiment analysis is also conducted to determine students' feelings toward faculty support using NLPTK, Textblob, and Flair.

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
